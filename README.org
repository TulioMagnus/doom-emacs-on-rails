* Solargraph
To configure solargraph for the full potential in your project, follow this steps: https://github.com/otavioschwanck/solargraph-rails

* New to emacs?
If is your first time using emacs, i strongly recommended you to do the emacs tutorial.  After the emacs start, press Alt+x and type: help-with-tutorial and press enter.
After the tutorial is done, press Alt+x, and run *projectile-discover-projects-in-directory*, after this, projectile will know where is your projects folder!
