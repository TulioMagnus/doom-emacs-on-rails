* Description
# Personal configuration for doom emacs

+ Working with JS
+ Full functional with Ruby on Rails
+ Some new functions added.
+ solargraph for autocompletes (C-p and C-S-p to complete with buffers text)

* Prerequisites
 - Git 2.23+
 - Emacs 26.1+ (27 is recommended) with GNUTLS support
 - ripgrep 11.0+
 - GNU find
 - OPTIONAL fd 7.3.0+ (improves file indexing performance for some commands)

* Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/otavioschwanck/doom_emacs_dotfiles.git ~/.doom.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+END_SRC

* Method Generator
I've developed a emacs function to generate methods in Ruby files.  To use, just press =C-M-enter=.
If the method name is init, it creates a initialize settings the args on instance variables.

Syntax: method_name@arg_1,arg_2,arg_n;method_two@arg_1,arg_2,arg_n

* Tips
** Search and replace in whole project
You can search and replace by pressing =SPC s p= to search in project, then, =C-c C-e= to open the search on a buffer.  To replace some word, just run =:%s/old_text/new_text/g=. You also can use the multiple cursors
** Multiple-cursors
To use multiple-cursors, select the word, then, press =M-d= to go foward or =M-D= to go backwards.  Press =C= to edit all.
